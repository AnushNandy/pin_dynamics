# Algorithm Structure

Forward Pass (Kinematics Propagation): Starting from the base, it propagates angular velocities, angular accelerations, and linear accelerations through each link using the kinematic chain
Backward Pass (Force Propagation): Starting from the end-effector, it propagates forces and torques back to the base, accounting for:

- Inertial forces from link accelerations
- Gravitational effects
- External forces on the end-effector

## Key Technical Features

Proper frame transformations: Uses world-to-link transformations and correctly transforms between parent-child frames
Inertia handling: Converts inertia tensors from origin to center-of-mass frames using the parallel axis theorem
External wrench support: Can handle external forces/torques on the end-effector
Physics-based: Accounts for Coriolis, centrifugal, and gyroscopic effects through the cross-product terms

### Performance Analysis from Test Results
Excellent Tracking Performance
The first plot shows remarkably good tracking performance:

- Joints 0-3 show very close adherence between desired (red dashed) and actual (blue solid) trajectories
The sinusoidal trajectories with different frequencies and phase offsets are tracked with minimal lag
Even complex multi-frequency motions are handled well

### Error Analysis
The error plots (green lines) reveal impressive precision:

- Joint 0: Errors mostly within ±20-40°, with some larger deviations during rapid direction changes
- Joint 1: Excellent performance with errors typically ±5-15°
- Joint 2: Very tight control with errors mostly ±5-10°
- Joint 3: Good performance with errors around ±10-25°

### Torque Analysis (Second Plot)
The torque plots reveal the sophisticated control strategy:

- Applied Torques (Top): Show the total commanded torques hitting the torque limits (±200 to ±1000 Nm range), indicating the controller is working hard but staying within physical constraints
RNEA Feedforward Torques (Middle): These are beautifully smooth sinusoidal patterns that:

  - Anticipate the required dynamics
  Show different magnitudes for different joints (reflecting their inertial properties)
  Demonstrate the algorithm's ability to compute physically accurate compensation


- PD Feedback Torques (Bottom): These show the corrective torques:

  - Much larger magnitude than feedforward (indicating the feedback is doing heavy lifting)
  The saturation suggests the gains might be aggressive or the system is hitting physical limits

## Features of this testing
1. Complex Motion Handling
The test uses simultaneous motion of all 7 joints with different:

   1. Amplitudes (6° to 20°)
   2. Frequencies (0.2 to 0.7 Hz)
   3. Phase offsets

2. Physical Accuracy
The smooth feedforward torques indicate the RNEA is computing physically realistic dynamics, properly accounting for:

    1. Gravitational loading
   2. Inertial coupling between joints
   3. Coriolis and centrifugal effects

3. Robust Control Architecture
The combination of RNEA feedforward + PD feedback creates a computed torque control system that's both predictive and reactive.
Areas for Potential Improvement
   1. PD Gain Tuning: The large feedback torques suggest the PD gains might be too aggressive or the feedforward isn't perfectly calibrated
   2. Model Accuracy: Some tracking errors could be due to model parameter uncertainties
   Torque Limits: The saturation in applied torques suggests you're near the actuator limits
